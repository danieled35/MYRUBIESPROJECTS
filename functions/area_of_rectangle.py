# # Exercise: Calculate Rectangle Area and Box Volume
# # 1. Create a Python function called calculate_rectangle_area that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters. This function should return the area of the rectangle, calculated as area = length * width.


# # 2. Create another Python function called calculate_box_volume that takes the area of a rectangle and the height of a rectangular box as parameters. This function should calculate and return the volume of the rectangular box, calculated as volume = area * height.
# # 3. Prompt the user to enter the length, width, and height as input using the input() function.

# 4. se the calculate_rectangle_area function to find the area of the rectangle using the provided length and width.
# 5. Then, use the calculate_box_volume function to calculate the volume of the box using the area and height.


# *use
# 6. Print the results, including the area of the rectangle and the volume of the box.
